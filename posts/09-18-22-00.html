		I was listening to a podcast with Tyler Cowen about his and Daniel Gross' new book, <em>Talent</em>. Tyler said that one question he likes to ask people is (paraphrasing), "What do you do every day that is analagous to a musician practicing their scales?" This question struck me because I don't know if I have a good answer to it.

	Daily ritualisitic practice focused on continuous improvement is an appealing idea, but I feel like there's no goal I have to apply that to. I few my goals as sequential, things to be done entirely before moving on to the next thing. But this is problematic, because I almost never finish the goal before deciding a new one is more important and moving on to that instead. Updating my priorities is fine, but too much switching limits your progress.</p>P

		So, I want to do more things in parallel instead of sequentially. Work on multiple things a little bit each day, like scales. Writing this blog is one of them. Another idea of Tyler Cowen's is to write every day. He has written at marginalrevolution.com daily for decades. That's impressive, and not something I want to emulate, but I do see the value in the practice. So that's what I'll try to do on this site, pushing myself to write more often than not, even if it is to just catalogue what is on my mind.
