		I was listening to the excellent Very Bad Wizards podcast today, when Tamler Sommers made the point that dogs live very happy lives full of meaning without knowing calculus. The context of the dicussion was the limits of human knowledge and our emotional reactions to grappling with what those limits might be.</p>
	<p>
		I don't have a profound reaction to that, but that pithy point has echoed in my mind today. I agree with it. It makes me wonder to what extent the edges of human comprehension and technology actually contribute to our well-being. I'm typically an ardent defender of capitalism among my lefty friends, but there is something to the point that cheaper TVs don't constitute the good life. (But only something, because vaccines and air conditioning do.)

		Hedonic treadmills are a common topic of conversation in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement">FIRE community</a>. I think they rhetorically bear more weight than they're fit to; the decreasing marginal utility of money is not that sharp from the point of view of an individual. But collectively, I think there's more than something to it. The things that really make us happy and live meaningful lives - community, companionship, friends, collaboration - seem out of reach for so many, especially in this country. It's sad that the urban places in the US that could provide some of that are prohibitively expensive. You can say that revealed preference shows that more people prefer to live in the suburbs, small towns, or rural areas, and I wouldn't disagree, but the high cost of housing in cities is a price signal that shows excess demand. If we accomodated it, I think great things would happen. Not just economic efficiency, but happiness and meaning too.
