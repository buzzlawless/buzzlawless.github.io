  <title>This Site Discriminates Against Robots</title>

		The internet today is in a sad state of affairs. Most content is consumed through social media apps that do not respect your privacy, your time, nor your preferences. In my effort to push back against this, I'm starting an old-fashinoned blog.</p>
	<p>
		More than just publishing my own website, I want to emphasize the interactions from the internet in days of yore: direct links to other people's sites. In that spirit, this site discriminates against robots. If you are reading this then you are not a robot (or you are a poorly behaved robot). I'm referring to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard">robots.txt</a>, a standard that lets websites opt-out from web crawlers used by Google and the like. I'm opting out.</p>
	<p>
		This means the only way you can find this website is by word of mouth or someone linking to it. I know this will reduce traffic, but I want to focus on metrics other than page views.
	<p>
		I suspect I may change my mind about this and allow robots in the future, but it's something fun to experiment with for now.
